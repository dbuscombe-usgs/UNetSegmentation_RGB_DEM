# UNetSegmentation_RGB_DEM
"3D" and "4D" image segmentation workflow example using RGB orthomosaic and DEM tiles

This is an example of how to do image segmentation with deep residual U-Net model frameworks, using RGB orthomosaics (3D imagery) and merged RGB orthomosaics and DEM rasters (4D imagery)

This is for USGS Coastal Hazards Program work for image segmentation of coastal environments. 

Requires:

* The ML-Mondays conda environment (see [the instructions](https://github.com/dbuscombe-usgs/MLMONDAYS#desktop-conda-environment-workflow))
* a working GDL installation
